# Dami-UI
    I have build barcode and qrcode generator using web components so that it becomes frontend framework independent and can be used in all frameworks.

## dami-barcode
    I have implemented barcodes for ean13, ean8, upcA, upcE, code11 and code39 which can be used by setting the "type" attribute on the element. Data should be set by the "value" attribute.

## dami-qrcode
    I have implemented qrcode for all error levels "L", "M", "Q" and "H" which can be set by setting the "errorCorrection" attribute on the element. Data should be set by the "value" attribute.
